**Other Services**

### Q: EpubPress was unable to find content for a page. What does that mean?

It usually means one of two things:
- The page you sent didn't have a large body body text that EpubPress thought would be good for a book. (eg. Sending a YouTube video or page of images)
- The content you were hoping to extract was in a part of the page that EpubPress considered irrelevant and was removed (eg. Sending a comment thread)

If you are a publisher and want to make your page easier to extract content from, follow the [Readability Publishing Guidelines](https://www.readability.com/developers/guidelines#publisher).
If you find a page that isn't being extracted properly, don't hesitate to email [support@epub.press](mailto:support@epub.press)

### Q: Is EpubPress available for other platforms?

EpubPress client are planned for a variety of platforms. To see the development status of different clients, visit the [Github repo](https://github.com/haroldtreen/epub-press-clients).

# Privacy Policy
EpubPress has no way of tracking who is creating ebooks.

When a book is created, the html from your selected tabs will be sent to a server for publishing into an ebook.  
When an ebook is requested, your email will be sent to the server if provided. This is necessary for email delivery and will not be used for any other purposes.

If no email is provided, the ebook will be returned as a file and no information about who requested the book will be saved.

All extension code is [open source](https://github.com/haroldtreen/epub-press-chrome).

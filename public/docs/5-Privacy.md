EpubPress has no way of tracking who is creating ebooks.
When a book is created, the html from your selected tabs will be sent to a server for publishing into an ebook.

When an ebook is requested, your email will be sent to the server if provided. This is necessary for email delivery and will not be used for any other purposes.

If no email is provided, the ebook will be returned as a file and no information about who requested the book will be saved.

All extension code is [open source](https://github.com/haroldtreen/epub-press-chrome).

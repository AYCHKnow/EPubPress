EpubPress has no way of tracking who is creating ebooks.  
When a book is created, only the urls of your selected tabs are sent to a server for processing.

When an ebook is requested, your email will be sent to the server if provided (this is necessary for email delivery).
If not, the ebook will be returned as a file and no information about who requested the book will be saved.

All extension code is [open source](https://github.com/haroldtreen/epub-press-chrome).
